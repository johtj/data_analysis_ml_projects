Tell me in depth about Lasso regression
**Svar**
Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a type of **linear regression** that adds **L1 regularization** to the cost function. It’s widely used for **feature selection** and **preventing overfitting** in high-dimensional datasets.

---

### **1. The Core Idea**
In ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, we minimize:

\[
\text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]

where \( y_i \) is the actual value and \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value.

Lasso modifies this by adding an **L1 penalty** on the coefficients:

\[
\text{Cost Function: } \min_{\beta} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j| \right)
\]

- \( \lambda \) controls the strength of the penalty.
- The penalty term \( \sum |\beta_j| \) encourages **sparsity** (some coefficients become exactly zero).

---

### **2. Why Use Lasso?**
- **Feature Selection**: Lasso can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively removing irrelevant features.
- **Handles Multicollinearity**: When predictors are correlated, Lasso tends to pick one and ignore others.
- **Prevents Overfitting**: By penalizing large coefficients, it reduces model complexity.

---

### **3. Comparison with Ridge Regression**
- **Ridge** uses L2 penalty (\( \sum \beta_j^2 \)), which shrinks coefficients but rarely makes them zero.
- **Lasso** uses L1 penalty, which can zero out coefficients → good for sparse models.
- **Elastic Net** combines L1 and L2 penalties for a balance.

---

### **4. Geometric Intuition**
- The constraint region for Lasso is a **diamond shape** (L1 norm), while Ridge is a **circle** (L2 norm).
- The diamond’s corners make it more likely for the solution to hit an axis → some coefficients become zero.

---

### **5. When to Use Lasso**
- When you have **many features** and expect only a few to be important.
- When you want **automatic feature selection**.
- When interpretability matters (fewer predictors).

---

### **6. Limitations**
- If \( p > n \) (more features than samples), Lasso can select at most \( n \) features.
- If features are highly correlated, Lasso may arbitrarily pick one and ignore others.
- Sensitive to scaling → **always standardize features** before applying Lasso.

---

### **7. Implementation in Python**
Here’s a quick example using `scikit-learn`:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Example: Lasso regression with alpha = 0.1
model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), Lasso(alpha=0.1))
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Coefficients:", model.named_steps['lasso'].coef_)
```

Would you like me to:
✅ **Draw a diagram** showing the geometric intuition of Lasso vs Ridge?  
✅ **Show a practical example with real data and plots** (e.g., coefficient shrinkage)?  
✅ **Compare Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net in detail with code and graphs**?  

Which one sounds most useful for you?
